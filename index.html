            <h4>Advances in Microgrid Technologies (pages 185 - 213). Elsevier</h4>
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-443-22187-3.00008-4"><h4 class="anchor-link" style="padding-bottom: 4px ;">DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-443-22187-3.00008-4</h4></a>
            <p>
                A side-channel attack (SCA) in cryptography is any attack that relies on the evaluation of measurements connected to the actual physical implementation of a system. Attacks on electronic equipment may go beyond conventional cryptanalysis to find cryptographic keys or other secrets; side-channel analysis is a different type of attack that takes advantage of information that leaks from physical implementations of, for example, cryptographic equipment. There are two types of side-channel attack that can be performed—profiling and nonprofiling attacks. This work comes under the nonprofiling type, where it uses the target's power consumption details to perform the attack. It checks the applications of machine learning algorithms in SCA. It first compares the accuracy of every machine learning metric for random forest implementation. In order to accomplish this, the issue of examining the relationship between power usage and encryption key is formalized as a supervised learning assignment. Here, the keys are encrypted using a cipher method called PRESENT and the work checks how close it can get to identify the keys. Each byte of the 8-bit key can have 256 values. Out of all such possible keys, the one right key must be found from the implementation under attack.

The app analyzes user sleep data using various models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Boosted Tree, and Linear Regression, to predict optimal sleep times. A unique Automatic option allows the app to select the best algorithm automatically, with an average Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 170 seconds, ensuring high prediction accuracy. The project also focused on optimizing performance by reducing the model size to just 545 bytes using Create ML, efficiently capturing key data relationships while maintaining minimal storage requirements.

                        Developed an engaging card game mobile application for the iOS platform, where players compete against a CPU opponent. The app dynamically updates the score based on the outcome of each match, offering an intuitive and competitive user experience. This project involved implementing game logic, real-time score tracking, and optimizing performance for smooth gameplay on iOS devices.

                  <p>
                    Designed and developed an iOS quiz application that presents users with three flags and challenges them to select the correct one. The app tracks and updates the user's score throughout the game, offering a fun and educational experience. This project involved implementing intuitive user interfaces, real-time score management, and interactive gameplay on the iOS platform.

                    <h3>Password Strength Analyzer Using SVM</h3>
                    <p>
                        A web application that detects the strength of the password entered, based on various parameters such as the presence of uppercase letters, numerical characters, special characters, and the length of the password. To achieve this, we used Support Vector Machine (SVM) due to its working efficiency with high-dimensional data. When deployed, the system accurately displayed the strength of the entered password and prompted the user to enter a new password when the entered password is weak. Additionally, the application provides users with suggestions for creating stronger passwords, enhancing overall security.

                  <h3>ML based Crop disease Detection</h3>
                  <p>
                    The proposed system's main approach is to detect crop diseases using diagnosis and detection systems based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We have compared the accuracy of three CNN models: ResNet50, ResNet152V2, and InceptionV3. After testing the models, we conclude that InceptionV3 is the best model for disease detection, with a model accuracy of 95.95% and a model loss of 31.04%. Furthermore, the system can provide real-time recommendations for treatment based on the detected diseases, helping farmers take prompt action to mitigate crop loss.
