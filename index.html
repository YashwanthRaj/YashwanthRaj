                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm Yashwanth Raj Varadharajan, a passionate software developer and problem-solver currently pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science at The George Washington University. With hands-on experience in full-stack development, machine learning, and UI/UX design, I thrive on building innovative solutions that create real-world impact.             
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the past few years, I have worked across cross-functional, multinational teams, contributing to projects that range from iOS applications and web platforms to machine learning models. My technical expertise spans JavaScript, SwiftUI, Python, React, Node.js, SQL, and cloud services like AWS and Firebase. I am also well-versed in API integration, agile development, and CI/CD practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond coding, I enjoy collaborating with teams, solving complex problems, and constantly learning new technologies. I believe that great software is built at the intersection of technical excellence and user-centered design. When I'm not immersed in development, you'll find me engaging in sports and outdoor activities like badminton, sailing, swimming, and ice skating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I will be graduating in May 2025 and am actively looking for opportunities in software development, data analytics, and machine learning. If you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my work, feel free to connect!

                    <h6 style="color: #212529; opacity: .8;">March 2024 - December 2024</h6>
                    <p>I started at Parkli LLC as a Software Developer, where I helped build a parking reservation app using SwiftUI, Firebase, and Docker. I designed wireframes in Figma and turned them into real app screens, making sure they looked good and were easy to use. I also worked on user authentication and backend API services using Firebase to keep the app secure and reliable.</p>
                    <p>To improve the development process, I set up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions. This helped automate updates and made it easier to release new versions quickly. I worked closely with my team to develop both the front-end and back-end, making sure everything functioned smoothly together.</p>
                    <p>Later, I took on the role of Front-End Lead, managing a team of seven developers. I guided the UI/UX design process from the first wireframe to the final app interface. I also made important architectural decisions to ensure the app was fast, scalable, and easy to maintain. Through code reviews and best practices, I kept the code clean and consistent.</p>

                    <P>At Access Healthcare, I contributed to various initiatives by applying my skills in Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Robotic Process Automation. My work focused on enhancing automation processes to improve efficiency and streamline operations within the healthcare domain.</P>
                    <p>I played a key role in developing Echo Talk, a web-based call center tool built with React.js. This tool integrated RESTful APIs to enable seamless access to patient records and enhance support agent interactions. I also collaborated on integrating ML-based voice analysis models, enabling real-time transcription and insights for better communication and workflow management. Alongside this, I worked on Echobot, a Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) automation suite that streamlined processes and integrated with leading automation frameworks. Our team’s efforts on Echo applications led to a 40% reduction in RCM implementation time.</p>
                    <p>Beyond RCM solutions, I contributed to the RParser Project, assisting in developing and training models for resume extraction and classification. This system categorized resumes into seven predefined roles, improving recruitment efficiency and automating candidate evaluation. My contributions helped drive innovation and efficiency in both healthcare automation and recruitment processes.</p>

My role involved conducting comprehensive research on market trends and investment opportunities, helping to identify potential growth areas. Through data-driven analysis, I contributed to various projects focused on risk assessment and financial forecasting.</P>
                    <p>One of my key contributions was analyzing consumer behavior and product preferences to support data-driven decision-making. I optimized product strategy by studying smartphone feature preferences and providing recommendations aimed at achieving a Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) score above 9. Additionally, I collaborated with team members to develop investment strategies, ensuring a strong foundation for informed business decisions.</p>

                            <p class="testimonial-card-subtitle">This project presents a modern surveillance approach for remote and border areas using a multifunctional robot, designed for defense and military applications. The robot can substitute soldiers at border areas, providing effective surveillance. It utilizes an Arduino UNO, ESP32 Camera, ESP8266 (NodeMCU) Wi-Fi module, and sensors like Ultrasonic Sensor, Photoresistor, Temperature, and Gas sensors. The bot features video streaming functionality through a cloud-connected Wi-Fi camera. Weighing less than a kilogram, it can navigate uneven terrains with ease, offering a versatile and efficient solution for real-time monitoring in challenging environments. </p>

To achieve this, we used Support Vector Machine (SVM), due to its working efficiency with high dimensional data. The system accurately displayed the strength of password entered, and prompted the user to enter new password when entered password is weak.</p>

                        <p>A side-channel attack (SCA) in cryptography is any attack that relies on the evaluation of measurements connected to the actual physical implementation of a system. Attacks on electronic equipment may go beyond conventional cryptanalysis to find cryptographic keys or other secrets; side-channel analysis is a different type of attack that takes advantage of information that leaks from physical implementations of, for example, cryptographic equipment. There are two types of side-channel attack that can be performed—profiling and nonprofiling attacks. This work comes under the nonprofiling type, where it uses the target's power consumption details to perform the attack. It checks the applications of machine learning algorithms in SCA. It first compares the accuracy of every machine learning metric for random forest implementation. In order to accomplish this, the issue of examining the relationship between power usage and encryption key is formalized as a supervised learning assignment. Here, the keys are encrypted using a cipher method called PRESENT and the work checks how close it can get to identify the keys. Each byte of the 8-bit key can have 256 values. Out of all such possible keys, the one right key must be found from the implementation under attack.</p>
