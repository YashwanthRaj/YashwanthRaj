              <p class="sub-title-education">Advances in Microgrid Technologies (pages 185 - 213). Elsevier <br> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-443-22187-3.00008-4">DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-443-22187-3.00008-4</a></p>
              <p>A side-channel attack (SCA) in cryptography is any attack that relies on the evaluation of measurements connected to the actual physical implementation of a system. Attacks on electronic equipment may go beyond conventional cryptanalysis to find cryptographic keys or other secrets; side-channel analysis is a different type of attack that takes advantage of information that leaks from physical implementations of, for example, cryptographic equipment. There are two types of side-channel attack that can be performed—profiling and nonprofiling attacks. This work comes under the nonprofiling type, where it uses the target's power consumption details to perform the attack. It checks the applications of machine learning algorithms in SCA. It first compares the accuracy of every machine learning metric for random forest implementation. In order to accomplish this, the issue of examining the relationship between power usage and encryption key is formalized as a supervised learning assignment. Here, the keys are encrypted using a cipher method called PRESENT and the work checks how close it can get to identify the keys. Each byte of the 8-bit key can have 256 values. Out of all such possible keys, the one right key must be found from the implementation under attack.
